# ambitools
ambitools is a collection of tools and audio plug-ins for 3D sound field synthesis using Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA). 

The plugins are written in the [Faust](http://faust.grame.fr) language, which allows them to be compiled for a multitude of architectures and platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, WebAudio, embedded systems, etc.)

Moreover, the code is written in a scalable way: there is no limit to the maximum Ambisonic order!
Other tools are also available, such as a 3D Visualizer written in the [Processing](https://processing.org/) language.
Enjoy!
